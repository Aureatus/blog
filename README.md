## Features
- Anyone can read posts that have been published, alongside any comments on it.
  - Users can comment on posts.
- Users can create posts, and edit or delete them.
  - Can select whether they are published when creating or editing them.
- Admins can see all posts, whether they are published or not
  - They can also edit and delete any post.

## Roadmap

- Let users delete and edit comments.
- Add ability for users to add reactions to either posts, comments or both, via emojis in a similar style to discord.
- Implement a rich text editor for writing posts.

## Known Issues

- ~~Changing published status of a post doesn't work.~~
- Admins can edit other peoples posts. Ideally, they should only be able to delete them.
- ~~Characters that are escaped by express-validator, are not displayed properly, since they're HTML and the post content is just rendered as text.~~
- ~~~The way loading of data is currently handled, if you're in a different region to where the server is hosted, the site will feel very unresponsive.~~ Implemented some loading states to alleviate this issue.
